## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive approach


### What I learned

Whit this challenge, i strengthned my CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox skills by implementing some of their attributes.
I'm getting more confident creating responsive webpage despite i still make some mistakes and i'm also getting used to
use the position attribute.

some meaningful code snippets:

```css
.quotation{
   position:absolute;
   z-index: 0;
}
.jeanette__section > p
```


### Continued development

I want to keep learning about CSS Grid and CSS FLexbox. I also want to improve the way i apply accessibility by using the
right html selectors and finally i will continue focusing on building responsive webpages.
